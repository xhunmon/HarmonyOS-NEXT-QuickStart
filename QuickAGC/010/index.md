# Complete Guide to Review, Release, and Common Issues

After uploading the package and qualification materials, your HarmonyOS Next app enters the review and release stage on AppGallery Connect (AGC). Only after passing review can the app go live. This article details the review process, release notes, common rejection reasons, troubleshooting strategies, and official resources to help developers complete the final step of publishing.

## 1. Review Process Overview

1. **Submit for Review**
   - On AGC, after confirming all info is correct, click "Submit for Review."

2. **Initial Automated Check**
   - The system automatically checks package signature, package name, permissions, qualification materials, etc.
   - If passed, the app enters manual review.

3. **Manual Review**
   - Reviewers check app features, UI, compliance, privacy policy, etc.
   - Focus on user agreement, privacy policy, permission requests, feature stability, etc.

4. **Review Result Notification**
   - Approved: The app enters release status and goes live on AppGallery automatically.
   - Rejected: The platform provides rejection reasons; fix issues and resubmit.

## 2. Release Notes

- **Review Cycle**: Usually 3-7 business days; complex apps or additional materials may take longer.
- **Staged Release**: Use staged release to launch to a small group first and validate compatibility and feedback.
- **Multi-Device Collaboration**: If supporting multiple devices, test and declare supported device types.
- **Subsequent Updates**: Each update requires a new review; plan testing and materials in advance.

## 3. Common Rejection Reasons

- **Incomplete or Unclear Materials**: Copyright, privacy policy, screenshots, etc., are non-compliant.
- **Package Name, Signature, or Version Mismatch**: Doesn't match AGC info.

## 4. Troubleshooting Strategies

- **Supplement and Improve Materials**: Ensure all required materials are authentic, clear, and compliant.
- **Optimize Features and UX**: Fix crashes, freezes, etc., to improve stability.
