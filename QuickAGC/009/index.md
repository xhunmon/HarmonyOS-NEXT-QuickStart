3. **Go to "Version Management"**
   - Select the target app, click "Version Management" or "Version Info."

4. **Upload Package**
   - Click "Upload Package," select the local `.app` file to upload.

1. **Software Copyright Certificate**
   - Upload a scanned copy of the Software Copyright Certificate or Electronic Copyright Certificate; ensure info is clear and authentic.
   - You can apply yourself (takes longer) or use a third-party service (about 300 RMB on Taobao).

2. **Privacy Policy Link**
   - Provide a standalone privacy policy page link; content must match the app's actual features.

3. **App Screenshots**
   - Upload high-quality screenshots showing core features; provide different sizes as required.

4. **Other Materials**
   - For special features (payment, maps, push, etc.), upload relevant qualification or authorization documents.

## 3. Common Issues and Tips

- **Signature Mismatch**: If the package signature doesn't match the AGC certificate, review will fail; always check signature info.
- **Incorrect Package Name or Version**: Must match AGC app info exactly.
- **Incomplete or Unclear Materials**: Upload clear, authentic materials; missing or unclear docs will be rejected.
- **Privacy Policy Mismatch**: Privacy policy must match the app's actual features and permissions.
- **Missing Special Feature Qualifications**: Prepare relevant documents in advance for payment, maps, etc.
