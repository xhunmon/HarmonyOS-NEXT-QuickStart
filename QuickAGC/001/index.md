# Complete Guide to Developer Qualification and Account Registration

Before developing and publishing a HarmonyOS Next app, developers must obtain valid developer qualifications and complete Huawei Developer account registration and real-name authentication. This article details the registration process, key points, common issues, and useful resources to help you take the first step toward app publishing.

## 1. Why Do You Need Developer Qualification?

Developer qualification means registering on the official Huawei platform and passing real-name authentication to obtain the legal right to develop and publish apps. Whether you are an individual or an enterprise, only with developer qualification can you publish and manage apps on [AppGallery Connect (AGC)](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/service/josp/agc/index.html#/).

## 2. Account Type Selection

Huawei Developer accounts are divided into "Individual" and "Enterprise":
- **Individual Account**: Suitable for personal developers, simple registration, ideal for small apps or personal projects.
- **Enterprise Account**: Suitable for companies/organizations, supports team collaboration and enterprise-level services, requires business license and related documents.

> **Tip**: If possible, register as an enterprise account for easier qualification review, ad integration, and app promotion.
