# Complete Guide to Functional Testing and Real Device Debugging

Before publishing a HarmonyOS Next app, comprehensive functional testing and real device debugging are crucial for quality assurance and passing review. This article details the testing process, real device debugging methods, common issues, and official resources to help developers efficiently identify and resolve problems.

## 1. The Importance of Functional Testing

- Ensure app stability, avoid crashes, freezes, and other user experience issues.
- Check if core features (login, payment, permission requests, etc.) work properly.
- Meet platform review requirements and improve approval rate.

## 2. Testing Process and Methods

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit test cases for each module to verify input/output and edge cases.
   - Use HarmonyOS official testing frameworks.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Check module collaboration, simulate real business flows.
   - Focus on login, data sync, payment, push notifications, etc.

3. **UI Automation Testing**
   - Use automation tools (UIAutomator, DevEco Studio built-in tools) for batch UI interaction testing.
   - Check UI adaptation, interaction logic, animation smoothness, etc.

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Test app startup speed, memory usage, CPU consumption on different devices.
   - Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks for better UX.

## 3. Real Device Debugging Practices

1. **Connect Real Devices**
   - Use USB or Wi-Fi to connect HarmonyOS devices to your development computer.
   - Enable developer mode and USB debugging on the device.
2. **DevEco Studio Deployment & Debugging**
   - In DevEco Studio, select the target device, click "Run" or "Debug" to deploy the app.
   - Use breakpoints, log output, etc., to troubleshoot and fix issues in real time.
3. **Multi-Device, Multi-Scenario Testing**
   - Test on devices with different models, resolutions, and OS versions to cover more scenarios.
   - Focus on adaptation, permissions, network, and other error-prone areas.
4. **Use Emulator Testing**
   - If real devices are insufficient, use the IDE's emulator (supports phone, foldable, tablet, PC, etc.).
   - Note: Mac Intel models do not support the emulator.

> **Tip**: After each feature iteration, run full regression tests to ensure new features don't break existing ones.

## 4. Common Issues and Tips

- **App Crashes/Freezes**: Analyze logs to locate and fix memory/performance issues.
- **Permission Request Issues**: Check permission declarations and dynamic requests; ensure features work after user grants permission.
- **UI Adaptation Issues**: Test on multiple real devices and adjust layouts/resources as needed.
- **Insufficient Test Coverage**: Add more automation test cases to improve efficiency and coverage.

## 6. Summary

Functional testing and real device debugging are essential before publishing a HarmonyOS Next app. Make a detailed test plan, combine automation and real device testing, and fix issues promptly to ensure a stable, efficient app. Consult official docs or the community for tough problems and keep improving product quality and user experience.
