# Complete Guide to Functional Testing and Real Device Debugging

Before publishing your HarmonyOS Next application, thorough functional testing and real-device debugging are crucial for ensuring quality and passing review. This guide details the testing process, debugging methods, common issues, and official resources to help developers efficiently identify and resolve problems.

## 1. Importance of Functional Testing
- Ensures app stability by preventing crashes and lag
- Verifies core functionality (login, payment, permissions, etc.)
- Meets platform review requirements and improves approval rates

## 2. Testing Process & Methods
### 1. Unit Testing
- Write test cases for each module to validate inputs/outputs and edge cases
- Use HarmonyOS official testing framework

### 2. Integration Testing
- Validate module interactions and simulate real workflows
- Focus on core processes: user login, data sync, payments, push notifications

### 3. UI Automation Testing
- Check UI adaptation, interaction logic, and animation fluency
- Python-based UI test script example:
```python
@Atomic Use Case
Setting Interface Browsing
@Preconditions
None
@Steps
1. Cold start Settings
2. Swipe up once to browse
3. Swipe down once to browse
4. Click Bluetooth
5. Swipe back
6. Click Bluetooth again
7. Swipe back
8. Click Display & Brightness
9. Swipe back
10. Swipe up to return home
APP_NAME = "Settings"
class SettingInterfaceBrowsing(ModelBase):

    def __init__(self, uidriver: IDriverPerf, case_id):
        ModelBase.__init__(self, uidriver, case_id)
        self.scene_no = "SettingInterfaceBrowsing"
        self.scene_name = "Setting Interface Browsing"
        self.scene_type = "System Settings"
        self.scene_path = "High-frequency Operations > Basic Operations > System Operations"
        self.set_model_pkg("com.huawei.hmos.settings")
        self.driver = uidriver

    def setup(self):
        self.driver.stop_app('com.huawei.hmos.settings')
        self.driver.go_home()

    @ModelBase.scene_recover
    def execute(self):
        # 1. Cold start Settings
        icon_pos = self.driver.find_app_in_launcher(APP_NAME)
        Tag = self.create_tag(step_name="Cold Start Settings", scene_type=SceneType.COLD_START)
        self.driver.touch_perf(icon_pos, tag=Tag)
        self.driver.wait(1)
        
        # 2-10: Execute UI operations (swipes, clicks, navigation)
        # ... (original logic preserved)
```

### 4. Performance Testing
- Measure launch speed, memory usage, and CPU consumption across devices
- Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks

## 3. Real-Device Debugging Practice
1. **Connect Devices**
   - Link HarmonyOS devices via USB/Wi-Fi
   - Enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging on devices
2. **DevEco Studio Deployment**
   - Select target device → Click "Run" or "Debug"
   - Use breakpoints and logs for real-time troubleshooting
3. **Multi-Device Testing**
   - Test across different models, resolutions, and OS versions
   - Prioritize adaptation, permissions, and network scenarios
4. **Emulator Usage**
   - Use built-in emulators (phones, foldables, tablets, PCs) when physical devices are unavailable
   - ⚠️ Note: Not supported on Intel-based Macs


## 4. Common Issues & Solutions
| Issue | Solution |  
|-------|----------|  
| App crashes/lag | Analyze logs → Optimize memory/performance |  
| Permission failures | Verify declarations and dynamic request flow |  
| UI adaptation errors | Test on multiple devices → Adjust layouts |  
| Inadequate test coverage | Expand automated test cases |
