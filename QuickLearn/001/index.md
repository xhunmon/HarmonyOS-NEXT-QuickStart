## Building Your First HarmonyOS Application (ArkTS)

The following are complete steps to create a basic HarmonyOS application using DevEco Studio, based on the official quick start guide <mcurl name="HarmonyOS Application Development Quick Start" url="https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/quickstart-harmonyos-0000001050166723"></mcurl>:

### 1. Project Creation Process
1. Open DevEco Studio and click **File > New > Create Project**
2. In the template selection interface, choose **Application > Empty Ability** and click **Next**
3. Configure basic project information:
   - Project Name: `MyFirstHarmonyApp`
   - Bundle Name: `com.example.myapplication` (must be unique)
   - Save Location: Choose an appropriate directory
   - Compile SDK: Select the latest HarmonyOS SDK version
   - Model: **Stage** (recommended application model)
   - Language: **ArkTS**
4. Click **Finish** to complete project creation

### 2. Project Structure Analysis
After creation, the core directory structure is as follows:
```
MyFirstHarmonyApp/
├── entry/
│   ├── src/main/ets/
│   │   ├── entryability/
│   │   │   └── EntryAbility.ts  // Application entry
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   │   └── Index.ets        // Main page
│   │   └── app.ets              // Application configuration
│   └── src/main/resources/      // Resource files
└── build-profile.json5          // Project build configuration
```

### 3. Writing Basic UI Code
Open the `pages/Index.ets` file and replace it with the following counter application code:
```typescript
@Entry
@Component
struct Index {
  // Define state variables for automatic UI updates
  @State count: number = 0
  @State message: string = 'Hello HarmonyOS'

  build() {
    // Vertical layout container
    Column() {
      // Text component
      Text(this.message)
        .fontSize(30)
        .fontWeight(FontWeight.Bold)
        .margin(20)

      // Button component
      Button('Click me')
        .fontSize(20)
        .width(150)
        .height(50)
        .onClick(() => {
          // Click event handler: update state variables
          this.count++
          this.message = `Clicked ${this.count} times`
        })

      // Conditional rendering example
      if (this.count > 5) {
        Text('You clicked many times!')
          .fontSize(18)
          .fontColor(Color.Red)
          .margin(10)
      }
    }
    // Container style settings
    .width('100%')
    .height('100%')
    .justifyContent(FlexAlign.Center)
  }
}
```

### 4. Running the Application
1. **Running with Emulator**:
   - Click **Device Manager** in the toolbar and select or create a HarmonyOS emulator
   - Click the **Run** button (▶️) or use the shortcut `Shift+F10`

2. **Running on Physical Device**:
   - Enable developer mode on the device and enable USB debugging
   - Connect the device via USB and select it in DevEco Studio
   - Click the **Run** button to deploy the application

### 5. Code Analysis
- **@Entry**: Marks the current component as the page entry
- **@Component**: Declares a custom component
- **@State**: State variable decorator that automatically triggers UI updates when values change
- **Column**: Vertical layout container for organizing UI elements
- **Text** and **Button**: Basic UI components
- **onClick**: Button click event handler

### 6. Extended Exercises
Try modifying the code to implement the following functions to deepen understanding:
1. Add a reset button to reset the counter to zero
2. Change text color based on the number of clicks
3. Add an image component (using the `Image` component)

After completion, you will master the basic process of HarmonyOS application development, ArkTS syntax basics, and state management mechanisms. You can refer to official documentation to learn more components and APIs.
