   - **Passing Standard**: Full score 100 points, 60 points to pass

2. **HarmonyOS Application Developer (Intermediate)**
   - **Positioning**: Advanced development capability certification for developers with more than 6 months of HarmonyOS development experience
   - **Core Content**: Complex UI construction, state management, distributed capabilities, performance optimization, multi-device adaptation
   - **Exam Format**: Theoretical exam (120 minutes) + practical exam (180 minutes)
   - **Passing Standard**: 60 points in theory + 60 points in practice, both subjects must pass

3. **HarmonyOS Application Expert (Senior)**
   - **Positioning**: Expert-level capability certification for developers with more than 2 years of HarmonyOS architecture design experience
   - **Core Content**: Architecture design, cross-end solutions, security compliance, ecological integration
   - **Exam Format**: Technical review (project submission + defense)
   - **Passing Standard**: Comprehensive score ≥ 70 points by the review committee

### Exam Registration and Process
1. **Account Preparation**: Register a Huawei Developer Alliance account (https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/) and complete real-name authentication
2. **Select Certification**: Choose the target certification level on the certification page and view the exam outline
3. **Optional Training**: Official paid training courses are available (optional), including theoretical explanations and practical guidance
4. **Exam Appointment**:预约 exam time through the certification platform (theoretical exams support online, practical exams require designated test centers)
5. **Fee Payment**: 300 yuan/time for junior certification, 800 yuan/time for intermediate certification, 2000 yuan/time for senior certification
6. **Take Exam**:参加 exam at the appointed time, online exams require a computer with a camera and stable network
7. **Certificate Obtainment**: Electronic certificate can be downloaded on the platform within 3 working days after passing the exam, paper certificate requires additional application

### Core Exam Content Analysis
Taking intermediate certification as an example, the exam focuses on the following modules:

1. **ArkUI Declarative Development**
   - Complex layout implementation (List/Grid/Stack nested use)
   - Custom component development (@Component decorator, parameter passing)
   - Animation and interaction (property animation, transition animation, gesture response)

2. **State Management**
   - Application-level state management (AppStorage/LocalStorage)
   - Inter-component communication (@Link/@Provide/@Consume)
   - Data persistence (Preferences, database, file storage)

3. **Distributed Capabilities**
   - Device discovery and connection (DeviceManager)
   - Cross-device data sharing (DistributedData)
   - Service migration (AbilityStage, ServiceExtensionAbility)

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Startup optimization (cold start/warm start indicator optimization)
   - Rendering optimization (LazyForEach, virtual list)
   - Memory management (avoid memory leaks, large object optimization)

## Practical Suggestions
1. **Develop a Step-by-Step Preparation Plan**
   - Junior: 1-2 weeks (2 hours per day), focus on mastering official documentation and basic cases
   - Intermediate: 4-6 weeks (3 hours per day), balance theory and practice, complete 3+ complete projects
   - Senior: 3-6 months, focus on architecture design, participate in open source projects or enterprise-level projects

2. **Core Preparation Resources**
   - Official textbooks: "HarmonyOS Application Development Practice", "HarmonyOS From Entry to Proficiency"
   - Certification courses: "Certification Preparation Series" in Developer Classroom (https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/training/course)
   - Mock exams: Sample questions provided by the certification platform (requires purchase), third-party question banks (e.g., "HarmonyOS Developer Community")
   - Practical environment: Latest version of DevEco Studio + HarmonyOS NEXT simulator

3. **Exam Skills**
   - Theoretical exam:优先做有把握的题目, mark uncertain items for final review, pay attention to negative words like "incorrect" and "not included" in questions
   - Practical exam: Plan code structure first, develop modularly, reserve 30 minutes for debugging and optimization
   - Senior defense: Prepare project PPT (highlight technical difficulties and solutions), practice defense speech in advance

4. **Continuous Learning and Community Participation**
   - Join official certification study groups (apply through certification page) to obtain the latest preparation materials
   - Participate in official events like "HDC Developer Conference" to learn about certification policy updates
   - Share preparation experience in forums and help other candidates answer questions

## Summary and Outlook
HarmonyOS Developer Certification is not only a proof of technical capabilities but also a "passport" to enter the HarmonyOS ecosystem. As the ecosystem expands, certification certificates will become important references for enterprise recruitment and project cooperation. In the future, the certification system may expand to more fields such as IoT and vehicle infotainment, forming more细分能力评估维度. Developers should choose appropriate certification levels based on career planning, improve skills through systematic learning and practice, and seize development opportunities in the HarmonyOS ecosystem.
