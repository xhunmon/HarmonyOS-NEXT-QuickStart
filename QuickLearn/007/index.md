    - **Passing Score**: ≥60 in both sections

3. **HarmonyOS Application Expert (Senior)**
    - **Target**: Expert-level certification for developers with 2+ years of architecture design experience
    - **Key Content**: Architecture design, cross-device solutions, security compliance, ecosystem integration
    - **Exam Format**: Technical review (project submission + defense)
    - **Passing Score**: ≥70/100 from review committee

### Exam Registration Process
1. **Account Setup**: Register a Huawei Developer Alliance account ( and complete real-name verification.
2. **Select Certification**: Choose target level and review exam outline.
3. **Optional Training**: Enroll in paid official courses (theory + hands-on guidance).
4. **Schedule Exam**: Book exam slot online (theory) or at designated centers (practical).
5. **Fees**:
    - Junior: ¥300
    - Intermediate: ¥800
    - Senior: ¥2,000
6. **Exam Requirements**: Webcam-equipped computer + stable internet for online exams.
7. **Certificate Issuance**: Digital certificate within 3 business days; physical copy available upon request.

### Core Exam Content (Intermediate Example)
1. **ArkUI Declarative Development**
    - Complex layouts (List/Grid/Stack nesting)
    - Custom components (`@Component`, parameter passing)
    - Animations & interactions (property/transition animations, gestures)

2. **State Management**
    - App-level state (AppStorage/LocalStorage)
    - Component communication (`@Link`/`@Provide`/`@Consume`)
    - Data persistence (Preferences, databases, file storage)

3. **Distributed Capabilities**
    - Device discovery (DeviceManager)
    - Cross-device data sharing (DistributedData)
    - Service migration (AbilityStage, ServiceExtensionAbility)

4. **Performance Optimization**
    - Startup optimization (cold/warm launch metrics)
    - Rendering optimization (LazyForEach, virtual lists)
    - Memory management (leak prevention, large-object handling)

## Practical Recommendations
1. **Staged Preparation Plan**
    - Junior: 1-2 weeks (2 hrs/day) – Focus on official docs + basic cases
    - Intermediate: 4-6 weeks (3 hrs/day) – Balance theory/practice with 3+ projects
    - Senior: 3-6 months – Emphasize architecture via open-source/enterprise projects

2. **Key Resources**
    - Official textbooks: *HarmonyOS Application Development Practice*, *HarmonyOS from Beginner to Master*
    - Certification courses: "Exam Prep Series" on Developer Classroom
    - Mock exams: Official sample questions + third-party question banks
    - Dev environment: Latest DevEco Studio + HarmonyOS NEXT emulator

3. **Exam Strategies**
    - Theory: Prioritize confident questions; watch for negative keywords ("incorrect", "not")
    - Practical: Plan code structure first; reserve 30 mins for debugging
    - Senior defense: Prepare PPT highlighting technical challenges/solutions; rehearse delivery

4. **Continuous Learning**
    - Join official certification groups for updated materials
    - Attend HDC Developer Conference for policy updates
    - Share experiences on forums for peer support

## Conclusion and Outlook
HarmonyOS Developer Certification serves as both a technical credential and an "ecosystem passport." As the ecosystem expands, certifications will become critical for recruitment and collaborations. Future certifications may extend to IoT, automotive, and specialized domains. Developers should align certifications with career goals through systematic learning and hands-on practice.

## Case Study: Game Login (ArkTS)
Learn implementation details:


### Huawei Account One-Click Login
Core code using Game Service Kit:
```typescript
// GameApi.ets - Game login API encapsulation
import gamePlayer from '@hms.core.gameservice.gameplayer';
import promptAction from '@ohos.promptAction';

export class GameApi {
  // Unified login
  async unionLogin(): Promise<gamePlayer.UnionLoginResult> {
    try {
      const result = await gamePlayer.unionLogin();
      if (result.resultCode === 0) {
        promptAction.showToast({ message: 'Login successful' });
        return result;
      } else {
        promptAction.showToast({ message: `Login failed: ${result.resultCode}` });
        throw new Error(`Login failed with code: ${result.resultCode}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Union login error: ${JSON.stringify(error)}`);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  // Check user existence
  async checkUserExist(unionId: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Call backend API in real projects
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(true), 500));
  }
}

// Index.ets - Login page implementation
import { GameApi } from '../common/GameApi';

@Entry
@Component
struct LoginPage {
  private gameApi: GameApi = new GameApi();

  build() {
    Column() {
      Button('Huawei Account One-Click Login')
        .width(300)
        .height(50)
        .onClick(async () => {
          try {
            const loginResult = await this.gameApi.unionLogin();
            const isExist = await this.gameApi.checkUserExist(loginResult.unionId);
            if (isExist) {
              // Existing user silent login
              router.pushUrl({ url: 'pages/MainPage' });
            } else {
              // New user registration
              router.pushUrl({ url: 'pages/RegisterPage' });
            }
          } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Login failed: ${error}`);
          }
        })
    }
    .width('100%')
    .height('100%')
    .justifyContent(FlexAlign.Center)
  }
}
